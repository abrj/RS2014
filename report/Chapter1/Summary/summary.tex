\section{Summary}

This conclude our chapter on technical descriptions of recommender systems. In this chapter we have described recommender systems from a collaborative-based and content-based point of view, along with a brief description of a variety of ways to combine the two. There are many different sizes and shapes of recommender systems, and due to the time constraints on this report, it is very likely that we have only just scratched the surface of the RS world. It is very possible that there are numerous features that we have not been able to take into consideration.
In the next chapter will be presenting the philosophical theory needed in order to design a recommender system.
