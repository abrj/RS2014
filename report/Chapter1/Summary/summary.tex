\section{Summary}

This conclude our chapter on technical descriptions of recommender systems. In this chapter we have described recommender systems from a collaborative-based and content-based point of view, along with a brief description of a variety of ways to combine the two. There are many different shapes and sizes of recommender systems, and due to the time constraints on this report, it is very likely that we have only just scratched the surface of the world of recommender systems. It is very possible that there are numerous features that we have not been able to take into consideration.
The next chapter will present the philosophical theory needed to design a recommender system.
