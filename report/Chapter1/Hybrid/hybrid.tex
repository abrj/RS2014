\section{Hybrid approaches}
So far descriptions of collaborative and content-based recommender systems have been given in sections \ref{sec:collaborative} and \ref{sec:content}. These two have, of course, both advantages and disadvantages as we also have described earlier and both do also have challenges. To overcome some of these challenges, one could combine the approaches in to a 'hybrid'. This could for instance be in a case, if a system have a rich community of users and the items in that system could be compared by keywords, then recommendations could be made by combining the features of content-based recommendations with peer-users, which, in theory, could result in higher quality recommendations.
In the following a list of applied hybrizing-approaches will be presented, to outline the different methods for doing this:
According to \citep[p. 20]{TowardsTheNextGenerationOfRs} the methods can be classified as the following four: "(1) implementing collaborative and content-based methods separately and combining their predictions, (2) incorporating soe content-based characteristics into a collaborative approach, (3) incorporating some collaborative characteristics into a content-based approach, and (4) constructing a general unifying model that incorporates both content-based and collaborative characteristics". It should be noted here, that this list is probably not comprehensive and many, many other hybridized approaches do exists. 
The first methods is to implement the collaborative and content-based independently of each other and the obtain a recommendation for the same items from both and the afterwards either combining the rating from each system into a single rating or selecting the 'best' rating relative to the recommended item based on a predetermined quality. 
The second method is to add some content-based characteristics to a collaborative recommender system. Here the system uses the 'Profile learner' to compare the similarity between users and thereby partly overcomes some of the sparsity problems, since it is common that users-pair often does not have many rated in common. Another feature of this approach is that users can be recommended an item based not only if its highly rated by peer-users, but also just if this item matches the users profile. 
Third method somewhat does the opposite of the second one. This method uses collaborative characteristics to
