\begin{abstract}
\textit{This report offers a perspective upon the relation between recommender systems and the theory of Value Sensitive Design. To enable us to give an informative and thorough description of these, we used the topics to create a design proposal for a recommender system in the context of the elective courses found at the IT University of Copenhagen. This design proposal is not meant as a direct guideline for implementing the system, but it is describing key aspects to take into consideration, if one should choose to implement the proposal.\newline
The reason for looking into this subject is of interest and educational purposes and have provided us with relevant knowledge that are usable within other similar areas. The findings of this report have lead us to keep a more open mind towards the subject of values in the design of software systems.
}\newline

\textbf{Key words:} recommender systems, values in technology, value sensitive design, philosophy, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering 

% Use the form Introduction-body-conclusion
% - Identify our purpose (our motivation) (why did we do this study, why does it matter)
% - Explain the problem at hand (what is our research trying to understand or solve, a general problem or something specific, main claim or argument)
% - Explain our methods (how did we accomplish our study)
% - Give a conclusion (the meaning and importance of our findings)
% Use keywords and phrases: (recommender systems, values in design, )
% No specific points, stick to giving a broad overview
