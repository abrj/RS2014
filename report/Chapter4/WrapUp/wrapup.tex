\section{Conclusion}
We conclude this project and report with this final section. We have described important aspects of what we believe a good recommender system at minimum should include and suggested a novel design for how a recommender system for course found at ITU could be made.\newline

By the literature that we have surveyed it seems that an increasing focus upon Values in Design have begun to emerge in various fields of research. We recognize the great importance of designing with values in mind, which is what we have tried to do throughout this project. Along side this process, relevant literature of recommender systems have been used for the design of the ITU recommender system. While this have been a challenging task, we feel that we have obtained relevant knowledge about recommender systems in general and that we are able to take this knowledge with us into future projects related to Information Retrieval or similar areas.\newline
