\section{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Briefly project}
- A lot of literature of recommender systems and a lot of VSD. We have only covered a small fraction of the total.\newline
overfladisk rapport. To store areas, ingen tidligere kendskab. 
It is not as straightforward as one my imagine, when trying to combine a technological area with human-values in mind, even when using a framework built for this purpose. 

\subsubsection*{The 'best' recommender system}
What is a good recommender system?
- It might not be a simple question to answer, will always be very context specific\newline

\subsubsection{The ITU recommender system}
The design process is challenging without doing any code on the side. 

\subsubsection*{The learned stuff.....}
The ethical perspective\newline
Recommender systems


\subsubsection*{VSD Framework} Optional\newline
Using the VSD framework and finding values have been a fun and challenging experience. We started out thinking that it would be a somewhat straightforward linear process, but as it turned out it became more of an iterative approach. We started out like the framework itself suggested, by seeking to identify the relevant values for our project and bring them into the design process. However, this proved to be harder to do than we initially expected. Instead we found ourselves narrowing the list of proposed values from the framework, removing the values we did not feel had an inherent connection to our project. We did this without making any final selections on which of the remaining values to embed. We then continued our approach to design the system, and while doing this we kept the idea of 'value considerations in mind and noted whenever we were faced with a decision which could possibly affect the values in the system. \\
We believe that it is quite possible to develop a fully functional system without considering using the VSD framework for embedding the values into the system. An alternative to this developing approach could be to simply think of which values to implement in the system, in some cases maybe given in advance by the systems stakeholders. We do feel, however, that the fact that we had a variety of initial values helped us along in the process of both finding the values we felt was important to our system and also to keep one focused on the aspect of embedding values into the system in general.
