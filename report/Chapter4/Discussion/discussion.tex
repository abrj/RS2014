\section{Discussion}
\subsubsection{Next Step}
-How would the system be designed if it were to offer seats in courses instead of 'just recommending' courses to users? Or choosing/forcing courses for users, if they dont take courses by them self \newline

We have designed a RS based on similarity, but we started thinking about it as designing one which were based on DIVERSITY? --> Realised that similarity would be more beneficial for the students since it is probable that they will choose elective courses has a certain resemblance to their previous elected courses.


- A lot of literature of recommender systems and a lot of VSD. We have only covered a small fraction of the total.\newline


What is a good recommender system?
- It might not be a simple question to answer, will always be very context specific



\todo{quote Anders Albrechts Lund hvor han n¾vner at designere bruger for lang tid pŒ at forberede systemet til hvad det mŒske skal kunne, i stedet for at fokusere pŒ det man ved nu. Det er sv¾rt at se hvad der sker i fremtiden}\newline


\todo{describe the affect of deciding not to implement user interaction into the system: less chance of an emergent bias, less chance of a student who is a teachers assistant being able to get some unfair rights in relation to his or her fellow students.}

\todo{who is a stakeholder and who is not?: We had a discussion about whether a teacher of a course would be both a direct and indirect stakeholder, since they are responsible for adding text to the course descriptions which the system based it structuring of keywords on. }

\todo{do our system take into account that course descriptions can be changed over time? Meaning how do we handle new output from ITU?}


\todo{how do we handle a new course, how do we handle a student with no prior elective courses}

\todo{discussion about why a lot of the benefits for the stakeholders are potential --> because the system would have to developed and tested, and tests of user experience would have to be conducted in order to give a fair estimation of this statement}

\todo{for discussion: as the system is now, the teachers are editing the course description. If a teacher has some technical knowledge about recommender systems, they can possibly}

\todo{for discussion: What does our system output (mail to students) contain? Number of seats total, number of seats available, etc.}

\todo{discussion about value conflicts, when one value is implemented another goes out the door}	


\todo{discussion, it is hard to not in some way implement a bias}
