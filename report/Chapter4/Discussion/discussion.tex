-How would the system be designed if it were to offer seats in courses instead of 'just recommending' courses to users? Or choosing/forcing courses for users, if they dont take courses by them self \newline

-We have designed a RS based on similarity, but we started thinking about it as designing it which were based on DIVERSITY? \newline
