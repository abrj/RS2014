\todo{move this part}describe stakeholders, benefits/harms, and value identification in the VSD section. Move the text below to the part in chapter 2 where if fits in\newline

Stakeholders consists of individuals or groups that are directly or indirectly interacting with or affected by the system. Direct stakeholders are those individuals or groups that are interacting with the system in a direct manner or are subsequently affected by or interacting with the output of the system. Indirect stakeholders are the people who are affected by the system though they never directly interact with it. It is possible for an individual to be both directly and indirectly affected by the system, and hence being both a direct and indirect stakeholder.


Benefits and harms defines the good and bad sides that the system have for the stakeholders of the system.


In accordance with the VSD-framework, this section we will describe how we practically identified the stakeholders for the system along with the benefits and harms for these stakeholders. We will then continue to define which impact these benfits and harms will have on our values.


Stakeholders for the ITU recommender system:
In order to find our stakeholders, we sat down and tried to identify all people that were interacting with or affected by the system in any way. Below are the results we came up with.

Direct stakeholders:  These stakeholders include:
- Students. The students are interacting with the output of the system, and can be further divided into subgroups: Full time students (bachelors, masters) and part time students (bachelors, masters, single course students).
- Teachers. Our initial thought was that the teachers are resonsible for the course descriptions which defines the keywords for the individual courses, and hence have an impact on the system. We have subsequently discussed whether a teachers actually were a direct stakeholder, since our system only collects the data information from ITUs servers, and the teachers therefore do not have any direct interaction with the system. The reason we finally decided that they are part of the direct stakeholders is, that by changing the course description they will have the opportunity to alter the output of the system, hence they can be seen as a direct stakehodler)

Indirect stakeholders: 
- The teachers. The teachers are indirectly impacted in regards to whether students choose to sign up for their course(s) or not, since the course can potentially be cancelled if there are not a minimun number of sign-ups.
- Teachers assistants. Impacted indirectly in same way as teachers.
- Persons responsible for producing the non-keyword list. They 


The above show us that the teachers and the students that are teachers assistants are both direct and indirect stakeholders of the system . As it can also be seen, we did not find a great deal of different stakeholders, and we suspect that this could be because the amount of direct interaction that the system is really limited.
