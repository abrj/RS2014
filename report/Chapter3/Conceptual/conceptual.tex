\todo{describe stakeholders, benefits/harms, and value identification in the VSD section. Move the text below to the part in chapter 2 where if fits in.\newline

Stakeholders consists of individuals or groups that are directly or indirectly interacting with or affected by the system. Direct stakeholders are those individuals or groups that are interacting with the system in a direct manner or are subsequently affected by or interacting with the output of the system. Indirect stakeholders are the people who are affected by the system though they never directly interact with it. It is possible for an individual to be both directly and indirectly affected by the system, and hence being both a direct and indirect stakeholder.

Benefits and harms defines the good and bad sides that the system have for the stakeholders of the system. In \citep[p.12]{FriedmanVSDandIS} it is described that it might be possible in some way to make every human an indirect stakeholder of the system, but here stresses the importance of prioritizing the individuals or groups that are most affected on an indirect level. 

Identifying the values that are affected by the benefits and harms are done to help determine whether a specific value has been successfully implemented into the system.

In accordance with the VSD-framework, this section we will describe how we practically identified the stakeholders for the system along with the benefits and harms for these stakeholders. We will then continue to define which impact these benefits and harms will have on our values.


Stakeholders for the ITU recommender system:
In order to find our stakeholders, we sat down and tried to identify all people that were interacting with or affected by the system in any way. Below are the results we came up with.

Direct stakeholders:  These stakeholders include:
- Students. The students are interacting with the output of the system, and can be further divided into subgroups: Full time students (bachelors, masters) and part time students (bachelors, masters, single course students).
- Teachers. Our initial thought was that the teachers are responsible for the course descriptions which defines the keywords for the individual courses, and hence have an impact on the system. We have subsequently discussed whether a teachers actually were a direct stakeholder, since our system only collects the data information from ITUs servers, and the teachers therefore do not have any direct interaction with the system. The reason we finally decided that they are part of the direct stakeholders is, that by changing the course description they will have the opportunity to alter the output of the system, hence we believe they should be seen as a direct stakeholder)
- Persons responsible for producing the non-keyword list. They have are impacting the system in relation to the non-keywords they type in, since these can potentially alter the outcome of a keyword analysis, hence changing the relevance of a specific course.

Indirect stakeholders: 
- The teachers. The teachers are indirectly impacted in regards to whether students choose to sign up for their course(s) or not, since the course can potentially be cancelled if there are not a minimum number of sign-ups.
- Teachers assistants. Impacted indirectly in same way as teachers.
- IT University of Copenhagen. All the students can freely choose where they want to take their elective courses. ITU is indirectly impacted in the way that  through the system the students are encouraged to choose elective courses from within ITU. 


The above show us that the teachers and the students that are teachers assistants are both direct and indirect stakeholders of the system . As it can also be seen, we did not find a great deal of different stakeholders, and we suspect that this could be because the amount of direct interaction with the system is really limited. 


\subsection{Benefits and harms}

Benefits and harms for the stakeholders:
We recognized the different benefits and harms through a discussion following the definition of our stakeholders.

Benefits:

Direct stakeholders
- Students. They benefit from being given suggestions on behalf of their previous selected elective courses, which can then support them in finding their next elective course(s) that suit their preferences.
- Teachers. They benefit by being able to specify very precisely what the course is about and then getting students which have preferences for these kind of courses.
- Producers of non-keyword list. They benefit from the system being more effective in selecting the correct keywords.

Indirect stakeholders:
- Teachers. They benefit indirectly from the students being suggested courses according to their preferences, since the probability of the teachers getting motivated and interested students to their courses are heightened. They also benefit of students being recommended their courses, which will potentially help reach the minimum number of students of the course
- Teachers assistants. They benefit from the same as the teachers does, in that when the minimum student limit is reached, they have a job for the following semester.
- ITU. They benefit from the students being recommended courses from within ITU, which will potentially keep the student rate high on the ITU courses. Furthermore, they are potentially enhancing the students' overall welfare since the students possibly will attend an elective course they will enjoy.


Harms:

Direct stakeholders:

- Students. The students are harmed in the way that they are recommended elective courses based on their previous selections of these, which might not be the most beneficial for them if there exist a course with a subject they had not yet interacted with that would be more interesting for them.
Furthermore, if they do not have any previous elective courses, the system will have no information to base its recommendations on.
- Teachers. They are harmed in the the way that 
- Producers of non-keyword list. 

Indirect stakeholders:
- Teachers.
- Teachers assistants.
- ITU.
