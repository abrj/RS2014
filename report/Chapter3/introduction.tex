\section{Introduction}
So far the report have mainly been focused upon the types and ethology of different types of recommender systems and the theory for values in design. This should at this point of reading, have provided the reader with a overview of the two topics and a little feel of the relation between the two. For this third, and final chapter, the objective is to use and apply the information from \ref{chap:chapter1} and \ref{chap:chapter2} in order to design a recommender system, with some desired values in mind. It is important to note, that the proposed system will not be build, but only the designed at a fitting layer of abstraction. The most natural step would of course be to design, and along the side, implement the chosen design. The reasoning for not including this, is a two split decision. The first is a pure time related issue. This project was done over a period of approximately 3 months, where the primary focus have been upon reading the needed literature in order to present a fitting perspective upon the topics of recommender system techniques and values in technology. The second reason for not including a implementation stage are grounded in the process. A popular thought in these times are the one about agile and iterative development methods. Here developers wants to move away from the more traditionally waterfall method and into a more agile method, which in some cases means code-while-designing. This is a natural process, which converts the design decisions into code almost at the same time. This way there is a short way to prototypes. In order to do this, the design process has to reflect the levels of details needed to implement the decisions. The code will then end up reflecting the designed intentions, but at some point it is very likely that the code will begin to impact the design process, which is exactly why this methodology is so strong. Design and code is correlated and influences each other. Because of the time restraint, we believed the must appropriate approach, would be to focus only on the design process and excluding the implementation This way we will be able to work in a linear process and focusing on the best way to embed the desired values, without having to worry about the details of the implementation.\\
This means that the following section will go as much in to detail as possible for the design process, without worrying about the low level details of implementation and production. 
With this in place, it is possible to continue further in this chapter. The chapter is divided in to three parts, accordingly to the VSD framework described in section \ref{subsec:vsd_framework}, which starts with the conceptual phase.
