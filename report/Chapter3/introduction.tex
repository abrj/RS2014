\section{Introduction}
So far the report have mainly been focused upon the types and methology of different types of recommeder systems and the theory for values in design. This should at this point of reading, have provided the reader with a overview of the two topics and a little feel of the relation between the two. For this third, and final chapter, the objective is to use and apply the information from \ref{chap:chapter1} and \ref{chap:chapter2} in order to design a recommender system, with some desired values in mind. It is important to note, that the proposed system will not be build, but only the designed at a fitting layer of abstraction. The most natural step would of course be to design, and along the side, implement the chosen design. The reasoning for not including this, is a two split decision. The first is a pure time related issue. This project was done over a period of approximatly 3 months, where the primary focus have been upon reading the needed litterature in order to present a fitting perspective upon the topics of recommender system techniques and values in technology. The second reason
