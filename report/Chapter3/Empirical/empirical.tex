\section{Empirical}
This section could be about some data gathering from leading people from ITU, who has something to say about the student profile, when graduating from ITU. It could also be something about what leading people from ITU says in general about the students choice of optional courses and the purpose of having optional courses at ITU. 

Two sides:
1) Understanding the ITU domain (courses, education, ECTS, users, etc)
2) Questions:
Does the academic content description change for the courses or is is more or less static?
Why does the bachelor level have mandatory courses?
What is the purpose of elective courses?
What values would you like to have in a RS for ITU courses?
